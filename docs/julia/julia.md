# The Julia programming language

[Julia](https://julialang.org/) is a high performance, dynamically typed programming language that can be used in place of Python or Fortran for many purposes.
Within our group it is used primarily by the [NQCD](https://github.com/nqcd) software packages but is also used for microkinetic modelling simulations and some plotting tasks.

In this section you will find guides and tutorials to help get you up and running with Julia.

## Additional resources

### Julia documentation

For up-to-date and complete information about the Julia language refer to the [Julia documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/).
The first few sections of manual provide a good starting point for users that are already familiar with other languages.

### MIT: Introduction to Computational Thinking

MIT has made available their [Introduction to Computational Thinking](https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/) course that uses Julia for all of the lectures and exercises.
This is a useful resource for users that are less experienced programmers and computational scientists.

### Julia discourse

The [discourse platform](https://discourse.julialang.org/) is a forum specifically for posting questions about using the Julia language. This is a useful place for learning about ongoing projects within the Julia community.
