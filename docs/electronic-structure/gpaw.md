# GPAW

[GPAW: DFT and beyond within the projector-augmented wave method](https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw/)

GPAW is a density-functional theory Python code based on the projector-augmented wave (PAW) method and the atomic simulation environment (ASE). The wave functions can be described with:

- Plane-waves
- Real-space uniform grids, multigrid methods and the finite-difference approximation
- Atom-centered basis-functions
